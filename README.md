This is [arduino-ide 2](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide) compiled for raspberry pi os 64-bit.

## Installation

arduino-ide 2.0 is available as appimage.

Home directory on external usb disk recommended; home directory on internal sd card can be painfully slow.

To install, download and run the latest appimage from [releases](https://github.com/koendv/arduino-ide-raspberrypi/releases/).


## Developers

Compilation notes are in [README-DEVELOPER.md](README-DEVELOPER.md)
