## compiling the IDE

These are instructions on compiling for [arduino-ide 2](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide) from source on raspberry pi os 64-bit. Compiling is done using github actions, the same build process as on X86.

Compilation using github actions requires

- setting up your raspberry pi as a github [self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
- patching arduino-ide to add arm64 processors to the build process.

## set up raspberry pi

On the raspberry pi runner:

- Install Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit.
- install dependencies: node, yarn, and libraries.

```
sudo apt-get install libxkbfile-dev libsecret-1-dev
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
. ~/.config/nvm/nvm.sh
. ~/.config/nvm/bash_completion
nvm install 14.0.0
npm install --global yarn
```

- make sure python is python 3, not python 2.

```
python -v
```

## patch arduino-ide

Set up a copy of the arduino-ide github.

- in github, fork [arduino/arduino-ide](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide)
- patch your fork with file self_hosted_runner.patch
```
git clone https://github.com/koendv/arduino-ide-raspberrypi
git clone https://github.com/your_git_account/arduino-ide
cd arduino-ide
patch -p1 < ../arduino-ide-raspberrypi/self_hosted_runner.patch
git add .github/workflows/build.yml
git add arduino-ide-extension/scripts/download-ls.js
git commit -m arm64
git push
```

In .github/workflows/build.yml, this adds a new os "self-hosted", next to Windows, Ubuntu and MacOS.

## configure self-hosted runner

- configure a new self-hosted runner.
On github.com, go to your fork of the arduino-ide.
- In _Settings -> Moderation options -> Code review limits_, enable  "Limit to users explicitly granted read or higher access"
- In _Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New Self-hosted Runner_, choose:
	- Runner image: Linux
	- Architecture: ARM64
- Follow instructions to create a self-hosted runner, from "Create a folder" to "Last step, run it!".

Verify node and yarn are available before starting the runner, and that the node version is as configured above, in ``nvm install``:

```
node --version
yarn --version
./run.sh
```
This should output _Listening for Jobs_.

## build ide

On github.com, go to your fork of the arduino-ide.

- In "Actions", under "Workflows" choose "Arduino IDE", enable workflow and click "Run workflow"
- On the runner, output should be ``Running job: build (self-hosted)``. You can follow what happens in the build through the github web interface.

Build time is 35-45 minutes on a raspberry pi 4b, 8gb ram.
```
 $ ./run.sh
âˆš Connected to GitHub
Current runner version: '2.290.1'
2022-04-29 06:52:32Z: Listening for Jobs
2022-04-29 06:56:32Z: Running job: build (self-hosted)
2022-04-29 07:37:11Z: Job build (self-hosted) completed with result: Succeeded
```

## binaries

- After the run, arm64 binaries for raspberry pi are in "Artifacts."
- On github.com, go to your fork of the arduino-ide. Under "All workflows - Showing runs from all workflows" click on "Arduino IDE". The binaries are under "Artifacts - Produced during runtime
":
``Linux_ARM64_app_image`` and
``Linux_ARM64_zip``. Click to download.

- When the build is completed, stop the ``run.sh`` command. Someone might fork _your_ repository, do a pull request and [run code on your raspberry](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security). Still, with "Limit to users explicitly granted read or higher access" enabled, you would have to explicitly grant the user access first.
- When the binaries have been downloaded, delete your arduino-ide fork. It is no longer needed.
